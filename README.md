`Reactor Netty` offers non-blocking and backpressure-ready `TCP`/`HTTP`/`UDP`/`QUIC`
clients & servers based on `Netty` framework.

## Getting it
`Reactor Netty` requires Java 8 or + to run.

With `Gradle` from [repo.spring.io](https://repo.spring.io) or `Maven Central` repositories (stable releases only):

```groovy
    repositories {
      //maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
      maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/milestone' }
      mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
      //compile "io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty-core:1.1.2-SNAPSHOT"
      compile "io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty-core:1.1.1"
      //compile "io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty-http:1.1.2-SNAPSHOT"
      compile "io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty-http:1.1.1"
    }
```

See the [Reference documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/reference/index.html#getting)
for more information on getting it (eg. using `Maven`, or on how to get milestones and snapshots).


## Getting Started
New to `Reactor Netty`? Check this [Reactor Netty Workshop](https://violetagg.github.io/reactor-netty-workshop/)
and the [Reference documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/reference/index.html)

Here is a very simple `HTTP` server and the corresponding `HTTP` client example

```java
HttpServer.create()   // Prepares an HTTP server ready for configuration
          .port(0)    // Configures the port number as zero, this will let the system pick up
                      // an ephemeral port when binding the server
          .route(routes ->
                      // The server will respond only on POST requests
                      // where the path starts with /test and then there is path parameter
                  routes.post("/test/{param}", (request, response) ->
                          response.sendString(request.receive()
                                                     .asString()
                                                     .map(s -> s + ' ' + request.param("param") + '!')
                                                     .log("http-server"))))
          .bindNow(); // Starts the server in a blocking fashion, and waits for it to finish its initialization
```

```java
HttpClient.create()             // Prepares an HTTP client ready for configuration
          .port(server.port())  // Obtains the server's port and provides it as a port to which this
                                // client should connect
          .post()               // Specifies that POST method will be used
          .uri("/test/World")   // Specifies the path
          .send(ByteBufFlux.fromString(Flux.just("Hello")))  // Sends the request body
          .responseContent()    // Receives the response body
          .aggregate()
          .asString()
          .log("http-client")
          .block();

```
