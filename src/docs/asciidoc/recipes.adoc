==== Non Blocking Konami Code

If you made it that far, here a simple non blocking stream to scale up your Konami codes over websocket. Tell me about a reward... Don't forget to add *Netty* in your classpath along *reactor-netty*.

final TopicProcessor<Integer> keyboardStream = TopicProcessor.create();

HttpServer.<String, String>create(spec ->
		spec
			.codec(StandardCodecs.STRING_CODEC)
			.listen(3000)
	)
	.ws("/", channel -> {
		System.out.println("Connected a websocket client: " + channel.remoteAddress());

		return channel.upgradeToWebsocket()
			.then(() -> keyboardStream)
			.skipWhile(key -> KeyEvent.VK_UP != key)
			.buffer(10, 1) // <1>
			.map(keys -> keys.size() == 10 &&
				keys.get(0) == KeyEvent.VK_UP &&
				keys.get(1) == KeyEvent.VK_UP &&

System.out.println(konamis.await());

<1> Note the `buffer(size, skip)` use, we want to evaluate all last 10 keys combinations, 10 by 10. That means we need to create a new list of 10 keys for every key.
