This section provides a brief overview of `Reactor Netty` reference documentation. You do not
need to read this guide in a linear fashion. Each piece stands on its own, though they
often refer to other pieces.

[[latest-version-and-copyright-notice]]
== Latest Version and Copyright Notice

The `Reactor Netty` reference guide is available as `HTML` documents. The latest copy is available
at https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/reference/index.html

Copies of this document may be made for your own use and for distribution to others,
provided that you do not charge any fee for such copies and further provided that each
copy contains this `Copyright Notice`, whether distributed in print or electronically.

[[contributing-to-the-documentation]]
== Contributing to the Documentation
The reference guide is written in
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc] using https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antora], and you can find its
sources at {reactor-netty-github-repo}/docs.

If you have an improvement, we will be happy to get a pull request from you!

We recommend that you check out a local copy of the repository so that you can
generate the documentation by using the `asciidoctor` Gradle task and checking the
rendering. Some of the sections rely on included files, so `GitHub` rendering is
not always complete.

TIP: To facilitate documentation edits, you can edit the current page from the `Edit this Page` link located in the upper right corner sidebar. The link opens
an edit `UI` directly on `GitHub` for the main source file for the current page. These links are
only present in the `HTML5` version of this reference guide. They look like the following link:
link:https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/edit/main/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/about-doc.adoc[Edit this Page^, role="fa fa-edit"] to make changes to xref:about-doc.adoc[About the Documentation] page.
