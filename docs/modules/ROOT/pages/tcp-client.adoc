[[tcp-client]]
= TCP Client

Reactor Netty provides the easy-to-use and easy-to-configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`].
It hides most of the Netty functionality that is needed in order to create a `TCP` client
and adds Reactive Streams backpressure.

[[connect-and-disconnect]]
== Connect and Disconnect

To connect the `TCP` client to a given endpoint, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`] instance.
By default, the `host` is `localhost` and the `port` is `12012`.
The following example shows how to create a `TcpClient`:

{examples-link}/create/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/create/Application.java[lines=18..31]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`]
instance that is ready for configuring.
<2> Connects the client in a blocking fashion and waits for it to finish initializing.

The returned {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html[`Connection`]
offers a simple connection API, including {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableChannel.html#disposeNow-java.time.Duration-[`disposeNow()`],
which shuts the client down in a blocking fashion.

[[host-and-port]]
=== Host and Port

To connect to a specific `host` and `port`, you can apply the following configuration to the `TCP` client.
The following example shows how to do so:

{examples-link}/address/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Configures the `TCP` host
<2> Configures the `TCP` port

NOTE: The port can be specified also with *PORT* environment variable.

[[eager-initialization]]
== Eager Initialization

By default, the initialization of the `TcpClient` resources happens on demand. This means that the `connect
operation` absorbs the extra time needed to initialize and load:

 * the event loop group
 * the host name resolver
 * the native transport libraries (when native transport is used)
 * the native libraries for the security (in case of `OpenSsl`)

When you need to preload these resources, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

{examples-link}/warmup/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/warmup/Application.java[lines=18..39]
----
<1> Initialize and load the event loop group, the host name resolver, the native transport libraries and
the native libraries for the security
<2> Host name resolution happens when connecting to the remote peer

[[writing-data]]
== Writing Data

To send data to a given endpoint, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyOutbound.html[`NettyOutbound`]
to be able to write data.

{examples-link}/send/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Sends `hello` string to the endpoint.

When you need more control over the writing process, as an alternative for I/O handler you may use
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html#outbound--[`Connection#outbound`]. As opposed to I/O handler
where the connection is closed when the provided `Publisher` finishes (in case of finite `Publisher`),
when using {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html#outbound--[`Connection#outbound`], you have to invoke explicitly
`Connection#dispose` in order to close the connection.

{examples-link}/send/connection/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/send/connection/Application.java[lines=18..44]
----
<1> Sends `hello 1` string to the endpoint.
<2> Sends `hello 2` string to the endpoint.
<3> Closes the connection once the message is sent to the endpoint.

[[consuming-data]]
== Consuming Data

To receive data from a given endpoint, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyInbound.html[`NettyInbound`]
to be able to read data. The following example shows how to do so:

{examples-link}/read/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Receives data from a given endpoint

When you need more control over the reading process, as an alternative for I/O handler you may use
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html#inbound--[`Connection#inbound`]. As opposed to I/O handler
where the connection is closed when the provided `Publisher` finishes (in case of finite `Publisher`),
when using {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html#inbound--[`Connection#inbound`], you have to invoke explicitly
`Connection#dispose` in order to close the connection.

{examples-link}/read/connection/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/read/connection/Application.java[lines=18..38]
----
<1> Receives data from a given endpoint.

[[lifecycle-callbacks]]
== Lifecycle Callbacks

The following lifecycle callbacks are provided to let you extend the `TcpClient`.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Callback | Description
| `doAfterResolve` | Invoked after the remote address has been resolved successfully.
| `doOnChannelInit` | Invoked when initializing the channel.
| `doOnConnect` | Invoked when the channel is about to connect.
| `doOnConnected` | Invoked after the channel has been connected.
| `doOnDisconnected` | Invoked after the channel has been disconnected.
| `doOnResolve` | Invoked when the remote address is about to be resolved.
| `doOnResolveError` | Invoked in case the remote address hasn't been resolved successfully.
|=======

The following example uses the `doOnConnected` and `doOnChannelInit` callbacks:

{examples-link}/lifecycle/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/lifecycle/Application.java[lines=18..41]
----
<1> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `ReadTimeoutHandler` when the channel has been connected.
<2> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LoggingHandler` when initializing the channel.

[[tcp-level-configurations]]
== TCP-level Configurations

This section describes three kinds of configuration that you can use at the TCP level:

* xref:tcp-client.adoc#client-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options[Channel Options]
* xref:tcp-client.adoc#client-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger[Wire Logger]
* xref:tcp-client.adoc#client-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group[Event Loop Group]

[[client-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options]]
=== Channel Options

By default, the `TCP` client is configured with the following options:

{core-source-link}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClientConnect.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClientConnect.java[lines=35..40]
----

If additional options are necessary or changes to the current options are needed, you can apply the following configuration:

{examples-link}/channeloptions/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----

You can find more about `Netty` channel options at the following links:

[[ssl-and-tls]]
== SSL and TLS

When you need SSL or TLS, you can apply the following configuration.
By default, if `OpenSSL` is available, the
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#OPENSSL[SslProvider.OPENSSL]
provider is used as a provider. Otherwise, the provider is
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#JDK[SslProvider.JDK].
You can switch the provider by using
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContextBuilder.html#sslProvider-io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider-[SslContextBuilder]
or by setting `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`.

The following example uses `SslContextBuilder`:

{examples-link}/security/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/security/Application.java[lines=18..37]

[[server-name-indication]]
=== Server Name Indication
By default, the `TCP` client sends the remote host name as `SNI` server name.
When you need to change this default setting, you can configure the `TCP` client as follows:

{examples-link}/sni/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/sni/Application.java[lines=18..41]

[[metrics]]
== Metrics
The TCP client supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.tcp.client`.

The following table provides information for the TCP client metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-data-received[Data Received]
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-data-sent[Data Sent]
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-errors-count[Errors Count]
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.tls.handshake.time | Timer | Time spent for TLS handshake.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-tls-handshake-time[Tls Handshake Time]
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.connect.time | Timer | Time spent for connecting to the remote address.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-connect-time[Connect Time]
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.address.resolver | Timer | Time spent for resolving the address.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-hostname-resolution-time[Hostname Resolution Time]
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::partial$conn-provider-metrics.adoc[]

include::partial$alloc-metrics.adoc[]
include::partial$eventloop-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

{examples-link}/metrics/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer

When TCP client metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

{examples-link}/metrics/custom/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Enables TCP client metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/channel/ChannelMetricsRecorder.html[`ChannelMetricsRecorder`] implementation.

[[tracing]]
== Tracing
The TCP client supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[`Micrometer Tracing`].

The following table provides information for the TCP client spans:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| contextual name | description
| hostname resolution | Information and time spent for resolving the address.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-spans-hostname-resolution-span[Hostname Resolution Span].
| connect | Information and time spent for connecting to the remote address.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-spans-connect-span[Connect Span].
| tls handshake | Information and time spent for TLS handshake.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-spans-tls-handshake-span[Tls Handshake Span].
|=======

The following example enables that integration. This concrete example uses `Brave` and reports the information to `Zipkin`.
See the https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing#_micrometer_tracing_opentelemetry_setup[`Micrometer Tracing`] documentation for `OpenTelemetry` setup.

{examples-link}/tracing/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/tracing/Application.java[lines=18..81]
----
<1> Initializes Brave, Zipkin, and the Observation registry.
<2> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer.

The result in `Zipkin` looks like:

image::tcp-client-tracing.png[]

[[access-current-observation]]
=== Access Current Observation
Project Micrometer provides https://micrometer.io/docs/contextPropagation[`a library`] that assists with context propagation across
different types of context mechanisms such as `ThreadLocal`, `Reactor Context` and others.

The following example shows how to use this library in a custom `ChannelHandler`:

{examples-link}/tracing/custom/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/tracing/custom/Application.java[lines=18..80]
----
<1> Initializes Brave, Zipkin, and the Observation registry.
<2> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer.
<3> Custom `ChannelHandler` that uses context propagation library. This concrete example overrides only
`ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter#connect`, if it is needed, the same logic can be used for the rest of the methods.
Also, this concrete example sets all `ThreadLocal` values for which there is a value in the given `Channel`,
if another behaviour is needed please check https://micrometer.io/docs/contextPropagation[`context propagation library API`].
For example, you may want to set only some of the `ThreadLocal` values.

NOTE: When you enable Reactor Netty tracing within a framework, you may need to let Reactor Netty use the `ObservationRegistry` created by this framework.
For this purpose you need to invoke {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Metrics.html#observationRegistry-io.micrometer.observation.ObservationRegistry-[`reactor.netty.Metrics#observationRegistry`].
You may also need to configure the Reactor Netty `ObservationHandlers` using the API provided by the framework.

[[unix-domain-sockets]]
== Unix Domain Sockets
The `TCP` client supports Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) when native transport is in use.

The following example shows how to use UDS support:

{examples-link}/uds/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/uds/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Specifies `DomainSocketAddress` that will be used

[[host-name-resolution]]
== Host Name Resolution
By default, the `TcpClient` uses Netty's domain name lookup mechanism that resolves a domain name asynchronously.
This is as an alternative of the JVM's built-in blocking resolver.

When you need to change the default settings, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

{examples-link}/resolver/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/resolver/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> The timeout of each DNS query performed by this resolver will be 500ms.

The following listing shows the available configurations.
Additionally, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7766[`TCP fallback`] is enabled by default.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Configuration name | Description
| `bindAddressSupplier` | The supplier of the local address to bind to.
| `cacheMaxTimeToLive` | The max time to live of the cached DNS resource records (resolution: seconds).
 If the time to live of the DNS resource record returned by the DNS server is greater
 than this max time to live, this resolver ignores the time to live from
 the DNS server and uses use this max time to live.
 Default to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
| `cacheMinTimeToLive` | The min time to live of the cached DNS resource records (resolution: seconds).
 If the time to live of the DNS resource record returned by the DNS server is less
 than this min time to live, this resolver ignores the time to live from
 the DNS server and uses this min time to live.
 Default: 0.
| `cacheNegativeTimeToLive` | The time to live of the cache for the failed DNS queries (resolution: seconds). Default: 0.
| `completeOncePreferredResolved` | When this setting is enabled, the resolver notifies as soon as all queries for the preferred address type are complete.
When this setting is disabled, the resolver notifies when all possible address types are complete.
This configuration is applicable for `DnsNameResolver#resolveAll(String)`. By default, this setting is enabled.
| `disableOptionalRecord` | Disables the automatic inclusion of an optional record that tries to give a hint to the remote DNS server about
 how much data the resolver can read per response. By default, this setting is enabled.
| `disableRecursionDesired` | Specifies whether this resolver has to send a DNS query with the recursion desired (RD) flag set.
 By default, this setting is enabled.
| `dnsAddressResolverGroupProvider` | Sets a custom function to create a `DnsAddressResolverGroup` given a `DnsNameResolverBuilder`
| `hostsFileEntriesResolver` | Sets a custom {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/HostsFileEntriesResolver.html[`HostsFileEntriesResolver`] to be used for hosts file entries.
Default: {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/DefaultHostsFileEntriesResolver.html[`DefaultHostsFileEntriesResolver`].
| `maxPayloadSize` | Sets the capacity of the datagram packet buffer (in bytes). Default: 4096.
| `maxQueriesPerResolve` | Sets the maximum allowed number of DNS queries to send when resolving a host name. Default: 16.
| `ndots` | Sets the number of dots that must appear in a name before an initial absolute query is made.
 Default: -1 (to determine the value from the OS on Unix or use a value of 1 otherwise).
| `queryTimeout` | Sets the timeout of each DNS query performed by this resolver (resolution: milliseconds). Default: 5000.
| `resolveCache` | The cache to use to store resolved DNS entries.
| `resolvedAddressTypes` | The list of the protocol families of the resolved address.
| `retryTcpOnTimeout` | Specifies whether this resolver will also fallback to TCP if a timeout is detected.
By default, the resolver will only try to use TCP if the response is marked as truncated.
| `roundRobinSelection` | Enables an
 {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/AddressResolverGroup.html[`AddressResolverGroup`] of
 {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/DnsNameResolver.html[`DnsNameResolver`] that supports random selection
 of destination addresses if multiple are provided by the nameserver.
 See {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup.html[`RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup`].
 Default: {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/DnsAddressResolverGroup.html[`DnsAddressResolverGroup`]
| `runOn` | Performs the communication with the DNS servers on the given
 {javadoc}/reactor/netty/resources/LoopResources.html[`LoopResources`]. By default, the LoopResources
 specified on the client level are used.
| `searchDomains` | The list of search domains of the resolver.
 By default, the effective search domain list is populated by using the system DNS search domains.
| `trace` | A specific logger and log level to be used by this resolver when generating detailed trace
 information in case of resolution failure.
|=======

Sometimes, you may want to switch to the JVM built-in resolver. To do so, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

{examples-link}/resolver/custom/Application.java
