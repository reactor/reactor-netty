[[tcp-server]]
= TCP Server

`Reactor Netty` provides an easy to use and configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`].
It hides most of the `Netty` functionality that is needed to create a `TCP` server
and adds `Reactive Streams` backpressure.

[[starting-and-stopping]]
== Starting and Stopping

To start a `TCP` server, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`] instance.
By default, the `host` is configured for any local address, and the system picks up an ephemeral port
when the `bind` operation is invoked. The following example shows how to create and
configure a `TcpServer` instance:

{examples-link}/create/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/create/Application.java[lines=18..31]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`]
instance that is ready for configuring.
<2> Starts the server in a blocking fashion and waits for it to finish initializing.

The returned {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableServer.html[`DisposableServer`]
offers a simple server API, including {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableChannel.html#disposeNow-java.time.Duration-[`disposeNow()`],
which shuts the server down in a blocking fashion.

[[host-and-port]]
=== Host and Port

To serve on a specific `host` and `port`, you can apply the following configuration to the `TCP` server:

{examples-link}/address/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Configures the `TCP` server host
<2> Configures the `TCP` server port

To serve on multiple addresses, after having configured the `TcpServer` you can bind it multiple times to obtain separate `DisposableServer`s.
All created servers will share resources such as `LoopResources` because they use the same configuration instance under the hood.

{examples-link}/address/MultiAddressApplication.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/address/MultiAddressApplication.java[lines=18..41]
----
<1> Configures the first `TCP` server host
<2> Configures the first `TCP` server port
<3> Configures the second `TCP` server host
<4> Configures the second `TCP` server port

[[eager-initialization]]
== Eager Initialization

By default, the initialization of the `TcpServer` resources happens on demand. This means that the `bind
operation` absorbs the extra time needed to initialize and load:

 * the event loop groups
 * the native transport libraries (when native transport is used)
 * the native libraries for the security (in case of `OpenSsl`)

When you need to preload these resources, you can configure the `TcpServer` as follows:

{examples-link}/warmup/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/warmup/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> Initialize and load the event loop groups, the native transport libraries and the native libraries for the security

[[writing-data]]
== Writing Data

In order to send data to a connected client, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyOutbound.html[`NettyOutbound`]
to be able to write data. The following example shows how to attach an I/O handler:

{examples-link}/send/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Sends `hello` string to the connected clients

[[consuming-data]]
== Consuming Data

In order to receive data from a connected client, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyInbound.html[`NettyInbound`]
to be able to read data. The following example shows how to use it:

{examples-link}/read/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Receives data from the connected clients

[[lifecycle-callbacks]]
== Lifecycle Callbacks

The following lifecycle callbacks are provided to let you extend the `TcpServer`:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Callback | Description
| `doOnBind` | Invoked when the server channel is about to bind.
| `doOnBound` | Invoked when the server channel is bound.
| `doOnChannelInit` | Invoked when initializing the channel.
| `doOnConnection` | Invoked when a remote client is connected
| `doOnUnbound` | Invoked when the server channel is unbound.
|=======

The following example uses the `doOnConnection` and `doOnChannelInit` callbacks:

{examples-link}/lifecycle/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/lifecycle/Application.java[lines=18..39]
----
<1> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `ReadTimeoutHandler` when a remote client is connected.
<2> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LoggingHandler` when initializing the channel.

[[tcp-level-configurations]]
== TCP-level Configurations

This section describes three kinds of configuration that you can use at the TCP level:

* xref:tcp-server.adoc#server-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options[Setting Channel Options]
* xref:tcp-server.adoc#server-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger[Wire Logger]
* xref:tcp-server.adoc#server-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group[Event Loop Group]

[[server-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options]]
=== Setting Channel Options

By default, the `TCP` server is configured with the following options:

{core-source-link}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServerBind.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServerBind.java[lines=38..46]
----

If additional options are necessary or changes to the current options are needed, you can apply the following configuration:

{examples-link}/channeloptions/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----

You can find more about `Netty` channel options at the following links:

* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html[Common ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/epoll/EpollChannelOption.html[Epoll ChannelOption]

[[ssl-and-tls]]
== SSL and TLS

When you need SSL or TLS, you can apply the configuration shown in the next listing.
By default, if `OpenSSL` is available,
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#OPENSSL[`SslProvider.OPENSSL`]
provider is used as a provider. Otherwise
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#JDK[`SslProvider.JDK`] is used.
Switching the provider can be done through
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContextBuilder.html#sslProvider-io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider-[`SslContextBuilder`]
or by setting `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`.

The following example uses `SslContextBuilder`:

{examples-link}/security/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/security/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----

[[server-name-indication]]
=== Server Name Indication
You can configure the `TCP` server with multiple `SslContext` mapped to a specific domain.
An exact domain name or a domain name containing a wildcard can be used when configuring the `SNI` mapping.

The following example uses a domain name containing a wildcard:

{examples-link}/sni/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/sni/Application.java[lines=18..47]
----

[[metrics]]
== Metrics
The TCP server supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.tcp.server`.

The following table provides information for the TCP server metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.connections.total | Gauge | The number of all opened connections.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-connections-total[Connections Total]
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-data-received[Data Received]
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-data-sent[Data Sent]
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-errors-count[Errors Count]
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.tls.handshake.time | Timer | Time spent for TLS handshake.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-metrics-tls-handshake-time[Tls Handshake Time]
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::partial$alloc-metrics.adoc[]
include::partial$eventloop-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

{examples-link}/metrics/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer

When TCP server metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

{examples-link}/metrics/custom/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Enables TCP server metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/channel/ChannelMetricsRecorder.html[`ChannelMetricsRecorder`] implementation.

[[tracing]]
== Tracing
The TCP server supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[`Micrometer Tracing`].

The following table provides information for the TCP server spans:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| contextual name | description
| tls handshake | Information and time spent for TLS handshake.
See xref:observability.adoc#observability-spans-tls-handshake-span[Tls Handshake Span].
|=======

The following example enables that integration. This concrete example uses `Brave` and reports the information to `Zipkin`.
See the https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing#_micrometer_tracing_opentelemetry_setup[`Micrometer Tracing`] documentation for `OpenTelemetry` setup.

{examples-link}/tracing/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/tracing/Application.java[lines=18..81]
----
<1> Initializes Brave, Zipkin, and the Observation registry.
<2> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer.

The result in `Zipkin` looks like:

image::tcp-server-tracing.png[]

[[access-current-observation]]
=== Access Current Observation
Project Micrometer provides https://micrometer.io/docs/contextPropagation[`a library`] that assists with context propagation across
different types of context mechanisms such as `ThreadLocal`, `Reactor Context` and others.

The following example shows how to use this library in a custom `ChannelHandler`:

{examples-link}/tracing/custom/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/tracing/custom/Application.java[lines=18..86]
----
<1> Initializes Brave, Zipkin, and the Observation registry.
<2> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer.
<3> Custom `ChannelHandler` that uses context propagation library. This concrete example overrides only
`ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter#channelActive`, if it is needed, the same logic can be used for the rest of the methods.
Also, this concrete example sets all `ThreadLocal` values for which there is a value in the given `Channel`,
if another behaviour is needed please check https://micrometer.io/docs/contextPropagation[`context propagation library API`].
For example, you may want to set only some of the `ThreadLocal` values.

NOTE: When you enable Reactor Netty tracing within a framework, you may need to let Reactor Netty use the `ObservationRegistry` created by this framework.
For this purpose you need to invoke {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Metrics.html#observationRegistry-io.micrometer.observation.ObservationRegistry-[`reactor.netty.Metrics#observationRegistry`].
You may also need to configure the Reactor Netty `ObservationHandlers` using the API provided by the framework.

[[unix-domain-sockets]]
== Unix Domain Sockets
The `TCP` server supports Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) when native transport is in use.

The following example shows how to use UDS support:

{examples-link}/uds/Application.java
[%unbreakable]
----
include::{examples-dir}/uds/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Specifies `DomainSocketAddress` that will be used
