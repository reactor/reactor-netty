[[faq.logging-prefix]]
== What is it meaning of the information that is prepended to every log record?
Reactor Netty adds information for the connection at the beginning of every log record (when this is possible).
There is a slight difference in the details for the connection when you use `TCP`, `UDP`, `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2`.

=== TCP and UDP
In case of `TCP` and `UDP`, the following is added at the beginning of every log record: the id of the underlying connection, local and remote addresses.

[[faq.logging-correlation]]
== How can I extract all log records for a particular HTTP request?
Reactor Netty adds information for the connection at the beginning of every log record (when this is possible).
Use the id of the connection in order to extract all log records for a particular HTTP request.
