[[udp-client]]
= UDP Client

Reactor Netty provides the easy-to-use and easy-to-configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpClient.html[`UdpClient`].
It hides most of the Netty functionality that is required to create a `UDP` client
and adds Reactive Streams backpressure.

== Connecting and Disconnecting

To connect the UDP client to a given endpoint, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpClient.html[UdpClient] instance.
By default, the host is configured for `localhost` and the port is `12012`.
The following example shows how to create and connect a UDP client:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/create/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/create/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpClient.html[`UdpClient`]
instance that is ready for configuring.
<2> Connects the client in a blocking fashion and waits for it to finish initializing.
====

The returned {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html[`Connection`]
offers a simple connection API, including {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableChannel.html#disposeNow-java.time.Duration-[`disposeNow()`],
which shuts the client down in a blocking fashion.

=== Host and Port

To connect to a specific `host` and `port`, you can apply the following configuration to the `UDP` client:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/address/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Configures the `host` to which this client should connect
<2> Configures the `port` to which this client should connect
====

== Eager Initialization

By default, the initialization of the `UdpClient` resources happens on demand. This means that the `connect
operation` absorbs the extra time needed to initialize and load:

 * the event loop group
 * the host name resolver
 * the native transport libraries (when native transport is used)

When you need to preload these resources, you can configure the `UdpClient` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----
<1> Initialize and load the event loop group, the host name resolver, and the native transport libraries
<2> Host name resolution happens when connecting to the remote peer
====

== Writing Data

To send data to a given peer, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpOutbound.html[`UdpOutbound`],
to be able to write data.

The following example shows how to send `hello`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/send/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Sends `hello` string to the remote peer.
====

== Consuming Data

To receive data from a given peer, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpInbound.html[`UdpInbound`],
to be able to read data.
The following example shows how to consume data:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/read/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Receives data from a given peer
====

== Lifecycle Callbacks

The following lifecycle callbacks are provided to let you extend the `UdpClient`:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Callback | Description
| `doAfterResolve` | Invoked after the remote address has been resolved successfully.
| `doOnChannelInit` | Invoked when initializing the channel.
| `doOnConnect` | Invoked when the channel is about to connect.
| `doOnConnected` | Invoked after the channel has been connected.
| `doOnDisconnected` | Invoked after the channel has been disconnected.
| `doOnResolve` | Invoked when the remote address is about to be resolved.
| `doOnResolveError` | Invoked in case the remote address hasn't been resolved successfully.
|=======

The following example uses the `doOnConnected` and `doOnChannelInit` callbacks:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----
<1> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LineBasedFrameDecoder` when the channel has been connected.
<2> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LoggingHandler` when initializing the channel.
====

== Connection Configuration

This section describes three kinds of configuration that you can use at the UDP level:

* <<client-udp-connection-configurations-channel-options>>
* <<client-udp-connection-configurations-wire-logger>>
* <<client-udp-connection-configurations-event-loop-group>>

[[client-udp-connection-configurations-channel-options]]
=== Channel Options

By default, the `UDP` client is configured with the following options:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpClientConnect.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/udp/UdpClientConnect.java[lines=37..42]
----
====

If you need additional options or need to change the current options, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
====

You can find more about Netty channel options at the following links:

* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html[Common ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/epoll/EpollChannelOption.html[Epoll ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/kqueue/KQueueChannelOption.html[KQueue ChannelOption]
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/socketOpt.html[Socket Options]

include::wire-logger.adoc[]

[[client-udp-connection-configurations-event-loop-group]]
=== Event Loop Group

By default, the UDP client uses "`Event Loop Group,`" where the number of the worker threads equals the number of
processors available to the runtime on initialization (but with a minimum value of 4). When you need a different configuration,
you can use one of the {javadoc}/reactor/netty/resources/LoopResources.html[`LoopResources`]`#create`
methods.

The following listing shows the default configuration for the "`Event Loop Group`":

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java[lines=86..120]
----
====

If you need changes to the these settings, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java[lines=18..38]
----
====

== Metrics
The UDP client supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.udp.client`.

The following table provides information for the UDP client metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.udp.client.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes
| reactor.netty.udp.client.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes
| reactor.netty.udp.client.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred
| reactor.netty.udp.client.connect.time | Timer | Time spent for connecting to the remote address
| reactor.netty.udp.client.address.resolver | Timer | Time spent for resolving the address
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::alloc-metrics.adoc[]
include::eventloop-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer
====

When UDP client metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Enables UDP client metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/channel/ChannelMetricsRecorder.html[`ChannelMetricsRecorder`] implementation.
====

== Unix Domain Sockets
The `UdpClient` supports Unix Domain Datagram Sockets (UDS) when native transport is in use.

The following example shows how to use UDS support:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java[lines=18..42]
----
<1> Specifies `DomainSocketAddress` that will be used
====
