[[tcp-client]]
= TCP Client

Reactor Netty provides the easy-to-use and easy-to-configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`].
It hides most of the Netty functionality that is needed in order to create a `TCP` client
and adds Reactive Streams backpressure.

== Connect and Disconnect

To connect the `TCP` client to a given endpoint, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`] instance.
By default, the `host` is `localhost` and the `port` is `12012`.
The following example shows how to create a `TcpClient`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/create/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/create/Application.java[lines=18..31]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClient.html[`TcpClient`]
instance that is ready for configuring.
<2> Connects the client in a blocking fashion and waits for it to finish initializing.
====

The returned {javadoc}/reactor/netty/Connection.html[`Connection`]
offers a simple connection API, including {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableChannel.html#disposeNow-java.time.Duration-[`disposeNow()`],
which shuts the client down in a blocking fashion.

=== Host and Port

To connect to a specific `host` and `port`, you can apply the following configuration to the `TCP` client.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/address/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Configures the `TCP` host
<2> Configures the `TCP` port
====

== Eager Initialization

By default, the initialization of the `TcpClient` resources happens on demand. This means that the `connect
operation` absorbs the extra time needed to initialize and load:

 * the event loop group
 * the host name resolver
 * the native transport libraries (when native transport is used)
 * the native libraries for the security (in case of `OpenSsl`)

When you need to preload these resources, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java[lines=18..39]
----
<1> Initialize and load the event loop group, the host name resolver, the native transport libraries and
the native libraries for the security
<2> Host name resolution happens when connecting to the remote peer
====

== Writing Data

To send data to a given endpoint, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyOutbound.html[`NettyOutbound`]
to be able to write data.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/send/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Sends `hello` string to the endpoint.
====

== Consuming Data

To receive data from a given endpoint, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyInbound.html[`NettyInbound`]
to be able to read data. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/read/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Receives data from a given endpoint
====

== Lifecycle Callbacks

The following lifecycle callbacks are provided to let you extend the `TcpClient`.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Callback | Description
| `doAfterResolve` | Invoked after the remote address has been resolved successfully.
| `doOnChannelInit` | Invoked when initializing the channel.
| `doOnConnect` | Invoked when the channel is about to connect.
| `doOnConnected` | Invoked after the channel has been connected.
| `doOnDisconnected` | Invoked after the channel has been disconnected.
| `doOnResolve` | Invoked when the remote address is about to be resolved.
| `doOnResolveError` | Invoked in case the remote address hasn't been resolved successfully.
|=======

The following example uses the `doOnConnected` and `doOnChannelInit` callbacks:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java[lines=18..41]
----
<1> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `ReadTimeoutHandler` when the channel has been connected.
<2> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LoggingHandler` when initializing the channel.
====

== TCP-level Configurations

This section describes three kinds of configuration that you can use at the TCP level:

* <<client-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options>>
* <<client-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger>>
* <<client-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group>>

[[client-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options]]
=== Channel Options

By default, the `TCP` client is configured with the following options:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClientConnect.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpClientConnect.java[lines=36..41]
----
====

If additional options are necessary or changes to the current options are needed, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
====

You can find more about `Netty` channel options at the following links:

* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html[Common ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/epoll/EpollChannelOption.html[Epoll ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/kqueue/KQueueChannelOption.html[KQueue ChannelOption]
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/socketOpt.html[Socket Options]

[[client-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger]]
=== Wire Logger

Reactor Netty provides wire logging for when the traffic between the peers has to be inspected.
By default, wire logging is disabled.
To enable it, you must set the logger `reactor.netty.tcp.TcpClient` level to `DEBUG`
and apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/wiretap/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/wiretap/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Enables the wire logging
====

By default, the wire logging uses {javadoc}/reactor/netty/transport/logging/AdvancedByteBufFormat.html#HEX_DUMP[AdvancedByteBufFormat#HEX_DUMP]
when printing the content.
When you need to change this to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/transport/logging/AdvancedByteBufFormat.html#SIMPLE[AdvancedByteBufFormat#SIMPLE]
or {javadoc}/reactor/netty/transport/logging/AdvancedByteBufFormat.html#TEXTUAL[AdvancedByteBufFormat#TEXTUAL],
you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/wiretap/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/wiretap/custom/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> Enables the wire logging,
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/transport/logging/AdvancedByteBufFormat.html#TEXTUAL[AdvancedByteBufFormat#TEXTUAL] is used for
printing the content.
====

[[client-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group]]
=== Event Loop Group

By default the `TCP` client uses an "`Event Loop Group`", where the number of the worker threads equals the number of
processors available to the runtime on initialization (but with a minimum value of 4). When you need a different configuration,
you can use one of the {javadoc}/reactor/netty/resources/LoopResources.html[LoopResource]`#create`
methods.

The following listing shows the default configuration for the Event Loop Group:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java[lines=85..114]
----
====

If you need changes to the these settings, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
====

== Connection Pool

By default, the `TCP` client uses a "`fixed`" connection pool with `500` as the maximum number of channels
and `1000` as the maximum number of the registered requests for acquire to keep in the pending queue
(for the rest of the configurations check the system properties below).
This means that the implementation creates a new channel if someone tries to acquire a channel but none is in the pool.
When the maximum number of the channels in the pool is reached, new tries to acquire a channel are delayed
until a channel is returned to the pool again.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java[lines=117..159]
----
====


If you need to disable the connection pool, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/pool/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/pool/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
====

If you need to specify an idle time for the channels in the connection pool, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/pool/config/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/pool/config/Application.java[lines=18..42]
----
====

NOTE: When you expect a high load, be cautious with a connection pool with a very high value for maximum connections. You might experience
`reactor.netty.http.client.PrematureCloseException` exception with a root cause "Connect Timeout" due
to too many concurrent connections opened/acquired.

=== Metrics
The pooled `ConnectionProvider` supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.connection.provider`.

include::conn-provider-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/pool/metrics/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/pool/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer
====

== SSL and TLS

When you need SSL or TLS, you can apply the following configuration.
By default, if `OpenSSL` is available, the
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#OPENSSL[SslProvider.OPENSSL]
provider is used as a provider. Otherwise, the provider is
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#JDK[SslProvider.JDK].
You can switch the provider by using
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContextBuilder.html#sslProvider-io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider-[SslContextBuilder]
or by setting `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`.

The following example uses `SslContextBuilder`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/security/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/security/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
====

=== Server Name Indication
By default, the `TCP` client sends the remote host name as `SNI` server name.
When you need to change this default setting, you can configure the `TCP` client as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/sni/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/sni/Application.java[lines=18..41]
----
====

== Proxy Support

The TCP client supports the proxy functionality provided by Netty and provides a way
to specify "`non proxy hosts`" through the {javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/ProxyProvider.html[`ProxyProvider`] builder.
The following example uses `ProxyProvider`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/proxy/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/proxy/Application.java[lines=18..38]
----
====

== Metrics
The TCP client supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.tcp.client`.

The following table provides information for the TCP client metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.tls.handshake.time | Timer | Time spent for TLS handshake
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.connect.time | Timer | Time spent for connecting to the remote address
| reactor.netty.tcp.client.address.resolver | Timer | Time spent for resolving the address
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::conn-provider-metrics.adoc[]

include::alloc-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..34]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer
====

When TCP client metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Enables TCP client metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/channel/ChannelMetricsRecorder.html[`ChannelMetricsRecorder`] implementation.
====

== Unix Domain Sockets
The `TCP` client supports Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) when native transport is in use.

The following example shows how to use UDS support:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Specifies `DomainSocketAddress` that will be used
====

== Host Name Resolution
By default, the `TcpClient` uses Netty's domain name lookup mechanism that resolves a domain name asynchronously.
This is as an alternative of the JVM's built-in blocking resolver.

When you need to change the default settings, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/resolver/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/resolver/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> The timeout of each DNS query performed by this resolver will be 500ms.
====

The following listing shows the available configurations:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Configuration name | Description
| `cacheMaxTimeToLive` | The max time to live of the cached DNS resource records (resolution: seconds).
 If the time to live of the DNS resource record returned by the DNS server is greater
 than this max time to live, this resolver ignores the time to live from
 the DNS server and uses use this max time to live.
 Default to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
| `cacheMinTimeToLive` | The min time to live of the cached DNS resource records (resolution: seconds).
 If the time to live of the DNS resource record returned by the DNS server is less
 than this min time to live, this resolver ignores the time to live from
 the DNS server and uses this min time to live.
 Default: 0.
| `cacheNegativeTimeToLive` | The time to live of the cache for the failed DNS queries (resolution: seconds). Default: 0.
| `completeOncePreferredResolved` | When this setting is enabled, the resolver notifies as soon as all queries for the preferred address type are complete.
When this setting is disabled, the resolver notifies when all possible address types are complete.
This configuration is applicable for `DnsNameResolver#resolveAll(String)`. By default, this setting is enabled.
| `disableOptionalRecord` | Disables the automatic inclusion of an optional record that tries to give a hint to the remote DNS server about
 how much data the resolver can read per response. By default, this setting is enabled.
| `disableRecursionDesired` | Specifies whether this resolver has to send a DNS query with the recursion desired (RD) flag set.
 By default, this setting is enabled.
| `maxPayloadSize` | Sets the capacity of the datagram packet buffer (in bytes). Default: 4096.
| `maxQueriesPerResolve` | Sets the maximum allowed number of DNS queries to send when resolving a host name. Default: 16.
| `ndots` | Sets the number of dots that must appear in a name before an initial absolute query is made.
 Default: -1 (to determine the value from the OS on Unix or use a value of 1 otherwise).
| `queryTimeout` | Sets the timeout of each DNS query performed by this resolver (resolution: milliseconds). Default: 5000.
| `resolvedAddressTypes` | The list of the protocol families of the resolved address.
| `roundRobinSelection` | Enables an
 {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/AddressResolverGroup.html[`AddressResolverGroup`] of
 {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/DnsNameResolver.html[`DnsNameResolver`] that supports random selection
 of destination addresses if multiple are provided by the nameserver.
 See {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup.html[`RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup`].
 Default: {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/resolver/dns/DnsAddressResolverGroup.html[`DnsAddressResolverGroup`]
| `runOn` | Performs the communication with the DNS servers on the given
 {javadoc}/reactor/netty/resources/LoopResources.html[`LoopResources`]. By default, the LoopResources
 specified on the client level are used.
| `searchDomains` | The list of search domains of the resolver.
 By default, the effective search domain list is populated by using the system DNS search domains.
| `trace` | A specific logger and log level to be used by this resolver when generating detailed trace
 information in case of resolution failure.
|=======

Sometimes, you may want to switch to the JVM built-in resolver. To do so, you can configure the `TcpClient` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/resolver/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/resolver/custom/Application.java[lines=18..37]
----
<1> Sets the JVM built-in resolver.
