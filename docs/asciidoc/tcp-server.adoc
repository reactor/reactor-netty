[[tcp-server]]
= TCP Server

`Reactor Netty` provides an easy to use and configure
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`].
It hides most of the `Netty` functionality that is needed to create a `TCP` server
and adds `Reactive Streams` backpressure.

== Starting and Stopping

To start a `TCP` server, you must create and configure a
{javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`] instance.
By default, the `host` is configured for any local address, and the system picks up an ephemeral port
when the `bind` operation is invoked. The following example shows how to create and
configure a `TcpServer` instance:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/create/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/create/Application.java[lines=18..31]
----
<1> Creates a {javadoc}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServer.html[`TcpServer`]
instance that is ready for configuring.
<2> Starts the server in a blocking fashion and waits for it to finish initializing.
====

The returned {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableServer.html[`DisposableServer`]
offers a simple server API, including {javadoc}/reactor/netty/DisposableChannel.html#disposeNow-java.time.Duration-[`disposeNow()`],
which shuts the server down in a blocking fashion.

=== Host and Port

To serve on a specific `host` and `port`, you can apply the following configuration to the `TCP` server:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/address/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/address/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Configures the `TCP` server host
<2> Configures the `TCP` server port
====

To serve on multiple addresses, after having configured the `TcpServer` you can bind it multiple times to obtain separate `DisposableServer`s.
All created servers will share resources such as `LoopResources` because they use the same configuration instance under the hood.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/address/MultiAddressApplication.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/address/MultiAddressApplication.java[lines=18..41]
----
<1> Configures the first `TCP` server host
<2> Configures the first `TCP` server port
<3> Configures the second `TCP` server host
<4> Configures the second `TCP` server port
====

== Eager Initialization

By default, the initialization of the `TcpServer` resources happens on demand. This means that the `bind
operation` absorbs the extra time needed to initialize and load:

 * the event loop groups
 * the native transport libraries (when native transport is used)
 * the native libraries for the security (in case of `OpenSsl`)

When you need to preload these resources, you can configure the `TcpServer` as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/warmup/Application.java[lines=18..36]
----
<1> Initialize and load the event loop groups, the native transport libraries and the native libraries for the security
====

== Writing Data

In order to send data to a connected client, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyOutbound.html[`NettyOutbound`]
to be able to write data. The following example shows how to attach an I/O handler:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/send/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/send/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Sends `hello` string to the connected clients
====

== Consuming Data

In order to receive data from a connected client, you must attach an I/O handler.
The I/O handler has access to {javadoc}/reactor/netty/NettyInbound.html[`NettyInbound`]
to be able to read data. The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/read/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/read/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Receives data from the connected clients
====

== Lifecycle Callbacks

The following lifecycle callbacks are provided to let you extend the `TcpServer`:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Callback | Description
| `doOnBind` | Invoked when the server channel is about to bind.
| `doOnBound` | Invoked when the server channel is bound.
| `doOnChannelInit` | Invoked when initializing the channel.
| `doOnConnection` | Invoked when a remote client is connected
| `doOnUnbound` | Invoked when the server channel is unbound.
|=======

The following example uses the `doOnConnection` and `doOnChannelInit` callbacks:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/lifecycle/Application.java[lines=18..39]
----
<1> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `ReadTimeoutHandler` when a remote client is connected.
<2> `Netty` pipeline is extended with `LoggingHandler` when initializing the channel.
====

== TCP-level Configurations

This section describes three kinds of configuration that you can use at the TCP level:

* <<server-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options>>
* <<server-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger>>
* <<server-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group>>

[[server-tcp-level-configurations-channel-options]]
=== Setting Channel Options

By default, the `TCP` server is configured with the following options:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServerBind.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/tcp/TcpServerBind.java[lines=40..48]
----
====

If additional options are necessary or changes to the current options are needed, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/channeloptions/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
====

You can find more about `Netty` channel options at the following links:

* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html[Common ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/epoll/EpollChannelOption.html[Epoll ChannelOption]
* {nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/channel/kqueue/KQueueChannelOption.html[KQueue ChannelOption]
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/socketOpt.html[Socket Options]

[[server-tcp-level-configurations-event-wire-logger]]
include::wire-logger.adoc[]

[[server-tcp-level-configurations-event-loop-group]]
=== Event Loop Group

By default, the `TCP` server uses an "`Event Loop Group,`" where the number of the worker threads equals the number of
processors available to the runtime on initialization (but with a minimum value of 4). When you need a different configuration,
you can use one of the {javadoc}/reactor/netty/resources/LoopResources.html[LoopResource]`#create`
methods.

The default configuration for the `Event Loop Group` is the following:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/reactor/netty/ReactorNetty.java[lines=86..120]
----
====

If changes to the these settings are needed, you can apply the following configuration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/eventloop/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
====

== SSL and TLS

When you need SSL or TLS, you can apply the configuration shown in the next listing.
By default, if `OpenSSL` is available,
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#OPENSSL[`SslProvider.OPENSSL`]
provider is used as a provider. Otherwise
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html#JDK[`SslProvider.JDK`] is used.
Switching the provider can be done through
{nettyjavadoc}/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContextBuilder.html#sslProvider-io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider-[`SslContextBuilder`]
or by setting `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true`.

The following example uses `SslContextBuilder`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/security/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/security/Application.java[lines=18..40]
----
====

=== Server Name Indication
You can configure the `TCP` server with multiple `SslContext` mapped to a specific domain.
An exact domain name or a domain name containing a wildcard can be used when configuring the `SNI` mapping.

The following example uses a domain name containing a wildcard:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/sni/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/sni/Application.java[lines=18..47]
----
====

== Metrics
The TCP server supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.tcp.server`.

The following table provides information for the TCP server metrics:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| metric name | type | description
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.connections.total | Gauge | The number of all opened connections
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.data.received | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data received, in bytes
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.data.sent | DistributionSummary | Amount of the data sent, in bytes
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.errors | Counter | Number of errors that occurred
| reactor.netty.tcp.server.tls.handshake.time | Timer | Time spent for TLS handshake
|=======

These additional metrics are also available:

include::alloc-metrics.adoc[]
include::eventloop-metrics.adoc[]

The following example enables that integration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/Application.java[lines=18..32]
----
<1> Enables the built-in integration with Micrometer
====

When TCP server metrics are needed for an integration with a system other than `Micrometer` or you want
to provide your own integration with `Micrometer`, you can provide your own metrics recorder, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/metrics/custom/Application.java[lines=18..35]
----
<1> Enables TCP server metrics and provides {javadoc}/reactor/netty/channel/ChannelMetricsRecorder.html[`ChannelMetricsRecorder`] implementation.
====

== Unix Domain Sockets
The `TCP` server supports Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) when native transport is in use.

The following example shows how to use UDS support:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
.{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java
----
include::{examplesdir}/uds/Application.java[lines=18..33]
----
<1> Specifies `DomainSocketAddress` that will be used
====
