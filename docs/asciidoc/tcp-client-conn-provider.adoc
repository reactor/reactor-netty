== Connection Pool
By default, `TcpClient` uses a "`fixed`" connection pool with `500` as the maximum number of active channels
and `1000` as the maximum number of further channel acquisition attempts allowed to be kept in a pending state
(for the rest of the configurations check the system properties or the builder configurations below).
This means that the implementation creates a new channel if someone tries to acquire a channel
as long as less than `500` have been created and are managed by the pool.
When the maximum number of channels in the pool is reached, up to `1000` new attempts to
acquire a channel are delayed (pending) until a channel is closed (and thus a slot is free and a new connection can be opened),
and further attempts are declined with an error.

NOTE: Connections used by the `TcpClient` are never returned to the pool, but closed. When a connection is closed, a slot is freed
in the pool and thus a new connection can be opened when needed. This behaviour is specific only for `TcpClient`
and is intentional because only the user/framework knows if the actual protocol is compatible with reusing connections.
(opposed to `HttpClient` where the protocol is known and Reactor Netty can return the connection to the pool when this is possible)

When you need to change the default settings, you can configure the `ConnectionProvider` as follows:

.{examplesdir}/pool/config/Application.java

include::{examplesdir}/pool/config/Application.java[lines=18..41]
----
<1> Configures the maximum time for the pending acquire operation to 60 seconds.

The following listing shows the available configurations:
[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======
| Configuration name | Description
| `disposeInactivePoolsInBackground` | When this option is enabled, connection pools are regularly checked in the background,
and those that are empty and been inactive for a specified time become eligible for disposal. By default, this background
disposal of inactive pools is disabled.
| `disposeTimeout` | When `ConnectionProvider#dispose()` or `ConnectionProvider#disposeLater()` is called,
trigger a graceful shutdown for the connection pools, with this grace period timeout.
From there on, all calls for acquiring a connection will fail fast with an exception.
However, for the provided `Duration`, pending acquires will get a chance to be served.
Note: The rejection of new acquires and the grace timer start immediately,
irrespective of subscription to the `Mono` returned by `ConnectionProvider#disposeLater()`.
Subsequent calls return the same `Mono`, effectively getting notifications from the first graceful
shutdown call and ignoring subsequently provided timeouts. By default, dispose timeout is not specified.
| `maxConnections` | The maximum number of connections (per connection pool) before start pending. Default to
2 * available number of processors (but with a minimum value of 16).
| `metrics` | Enables/disables built-in integration with Micrometer. `ConnectionProvider.MeterRegistrar` can be provided
for integration with another metrics system. By default, metrics are not enabled.
| `pendingAcquireMaxCount` | The maximum number of extra attempts at acquiring a connection to keep in a pending queue.
If -1 is specified, the pending queue does not have upper limit. Default to 2 * max connections.
| `pendingAcquireTimeout` | The maximum time before which a pending acquire must complete, or a TimeoutException is
thrown (resolution: ms). If -1 is specified, no such timeout is applied. Default: 45 seconds.

=== Metrics
The pooled `ConnectionProvider` supports built-in integration with https://micrometer.io/[`Micrometer`].
It exposes all metrics with a prefix of `reactor.netty.connection.provider`.
